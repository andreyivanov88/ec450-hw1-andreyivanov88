Writeup describing your implementation:
What was your overall strategy?
The original blink interval was set to ~ 50* 7.4ms (for the WDT handler). This was considered one unit &
then a counter declared (unsigned int c) was created to keep track of the SOS state. In order to count:
3 short blinks --> 3-interval pause --> 3 long blinks --> 3-interval pause -->
3 short blinks --> long pause (now c is reset to 0 to repeat)

What global variables did you use to keep track of the state of the system between WDT interrupts?
Just a single counter declared as:
unsigned int c;

What hardware did you use and how was it connected (for this HW the answer is probably to just way which on-board LED you used)
LED1 blinking was implemented with the mini usb connecting to the computer USB.
